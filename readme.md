# Save and archive all your [Coub](https://coub.com) videos and recoubs

`git clone https://github.com/Lutymane/save-coub-videos.git`

`cd save-coub-videos`

`yarn` or `npm i`

`yarn build` or `npm run build`

`node . [account_handle]`

The program will dump highest available quality of video and audio tracks separately which you can then merge with `ffmpeg` + a full dump of API info for every coub in `defs.json`.

Merger script will come later
